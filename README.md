# GyanAI

GyanAI is an AI assistant powered by the LLaMA 2 model made by Meta.
It is built in Python, and is available for Windows and Linux. It has a main chat feature, which is the same as chatting with a bot as Claude, ChatGPT, or Bard. It sends your input from the smaller input box to LLaMa 2 and gets the output. It sends the output to the big output text box below. It also has a shorten text feature that uses LLaMa 2 to shorten any text that you input from the main text box. Once you click Shorten Text, it sends the text to LLaMa 2 and it tells it to shorten the text. Once it recieves the output, it saves it to a file.
